# Changelog

## 0.9.0, pre-release

The first public version. Omarchy runs daily on one SM-T715, on Linux 6.12 with a 32-bit userland.

**Kernel**
- The Exynos 5433 in 32-bit mode on mainline: boot, SMP, clocks, IOMMU, watchdog.
- Display, GPU through Panfrost, touch, audio, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sensors, battery.
- The modem: MIPI LLI, and Samsung's `modem_v1` driver ported from 3.10.
- Touch keys, vibration motor, and both cameras through V4L2 with no ISP.

**Modem**
- `shannon-loader` boots the Shannon SS333 and supervises it.
- `shannond` speaks its IPC and offers ModemManager's D-Bus API: LTE, calls, SMS, mobile data,
  airplane mode, hotspot.
- The Phone and Messages apps, a ringing screen over the lock, an SMS sound and a glance at the
  screen.

**Desktop**
- Omarchy's packages for `armv7h`, and the omarchy-mobile touch shell patched for a tablet.
- A persistent root, a rescue in RECOVERY, and a firewall that only opens SSH on the USB cable.
- A screen lock you turn on by choosing a password.

**Known limits**
- One tablet tested. Nobody has followed the install guide from a clean clone yet.
- No emergency calls, suspend, hardware video decoding, frequency scaling or fingerprint reader.
- The rear camera wants the screen lit, and neither camera has a preview or autofocus.
- No root image is published: it would carry Samsung's files. You build yours.
